This project demonstrates a comprehensive approach to land-use and land-cover (LULC) classification using the powerful capabilities of Google Earth Engine. By leveraging satellite imagery, machine learning algorithms, and cloud-based processing, we aim to accurately map and analyze land-use patterns over time.

## About

LULC classification is essential for understanding environmental changes, urban development, agricultural patterns, and resource management. This project provides a streamlined workflow to classify land cover into categories such as:

* **Urban Areas**
* **Forests**
* **Agriculture**
* **Water Bodies**
* **Barren Land**
* **...and more**

## Key Features

* **Cloud-Based Processing:** Utilizes Google Earth Engine's scalable infrastructure for efficient analysis of large-scale geospatial data.
* **Machine Learning Integration:** Employs machine learning algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, SVM, deep learning) for accurate classification.
* **Multi-Temporal Analysis:**  Enables the analysis of land-use changes over time by utilizing satellite imagery from different periods.
* **Customizable:**  Easily adaptable to specific regions, timeframes, and classification schemes.

## Data Sources

* **Sentinel-2:** High-resolution multispectral imagery for detailed land-cover mapping.
* **Landsat:** Long-term archive of satellite imagery for historical analysis.
* **Other:** Potentially incorporates additional datasets like MODIS, DEM, and auxiliary data (e.g., climate, soil).

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:**  
   - Cloud masking, atmospheric correction, and image normalization.
   - Selection of optimal spectral bands and indices (e.g., NDVI, EVI).
2. **Training Data Collection:**
   - Careful selection of representative training samples for each land-use class.
   - Can utilize existing LULC products or create custom samples using visual interpretation or field surveys.
3. **Classification:** 
   - Training and validation of machine learning models.
   - Evaluation of model performance using accuracy assessment metrics.
4. **Post-Processing:**
   - Smoothing and filtering to refine classification results.
   - Accuracy assessment and validation using ground truth data (if available).
